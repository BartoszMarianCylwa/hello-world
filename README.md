# hello-world
My first repository.
As I wrote earlier, hello-world. I'm Bartosz and this is a very FIRST step of mine into programming.
Not gonna lie, all this stuff looks like a magic for me and it's scary, but I want to understand it and use it to make $$$.
Wish me luck, otherwise I won't finish IT studies, ha ha ha...
